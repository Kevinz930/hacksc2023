##Inspiration
“What are you doing here? – Go back into the kitchen! “ “Give me your Snapchat, you dirty fat slut?” “Can you send me nudes?”

No one should ever have to listen to this toxicity. Unfortunately, this is very common in today’s gaming communities even though gaming should be a fun and interactive environment for everybody. However, gaming companies fail to deploy effective banning systems and aliases. According to the 2021 Computer and Video Game Industry report, 48% of gamers in the U.S. (40% globally) are female. Unfortunately, only 12% of them feel the freedom to give away their gender identity in-game and as a result, struggle to find like-minded friends in-game. Despite the increasing popularity of gaming, women are still underrepresented and face challenges such as online harassment and discrimination. By creating a female-focused gaming community, women can connect with other like-minded individuals, find support and encouragement, and be a part of a welcoming and inclusive gaming community. Our motivation originated from the fact that we witnessed online harassment in gaming against women and felt powerless even though they were our friends. Now, we aim to combat this issue on a larger more impactful scale.

##What we do
Angel Shot is a safe space for female gamers to share their fears and get support against discrimination and harassment. In addition to that, it serves as a connecting platform to find other female gamers. This happens through indirect communication that is only revealed to a verified community member.

In order to Sign up for this community, each member has to go through the verification process to ensure a safe space, especially for female gamers. Next, she has to choose her favourite game and her in-game name. This name will be stored in a database on our website. When she enters a new game, we will use the API of the game publisher (e.g. Riot Games) to match our database with all players in her game and show only gamers that are also registered on our website. With that, she will be able to know that there is another female player on her or the opposite team and is able to connect either before or after the game. Our platform allows female gamers to connect with each other without the necessity to give up their female identity to all other players and the risk to expose themselves to potential harassment/discrimination.

##Why the name Angel Shot?
After the #MeToo movement, ordering an Angel Shot at a bar is a code that patrons can use to let the staff know that you are in an uncomfortable situation and need help. We are now translating this code into the online gaming community and creating a secure place that helps females connect to each other without exposing their identities to strangers.

##Why are 3 dudes creating a project for female gamers?
We were motivated to create Angel Shot as a result of witnessing females being subjected to sexual harassment and negative stereotypes while gaming, which left us feeling powerless. Secondly, we all know women who love to play games but are very cautious when talking to strangers in voice chat because they are afraid of being seen differently because of their higher voice.

##How we built it
This authentication system requires a username and password to log into a web application. Credentials are verified against a database, and if successful, the user is redirected to the "/home" endpoint. An error message is displayed if the credentials do not match. The frontend and backend communicate over the internet or a local network using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS and exchange data in formats like JSON/XML. Frontend libraries/frameworks like Axios/jQuery/Fetch and backend frameworks like Flask/Django/Express handle the communication, managed by tools like GraphQL/RESTful API design. This communication is essential for data exchange in web applications.

##Challenges we ran into
Verification process
Connecting sequels to a .js file
Connect HTML to CS formatting
Distinguish between get and post HTTP requests
Working with the original game API from Riot Games
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Very positive feedback from our female gamer friends, especially for the indirect communication
Fixing the issues with the different languages to bring them into one working program

##What we learned
Still learning
Refreshed how we used RESTFUL API and NodeJS

##What's next for Angel Shot
Next, we have to figure out how to bring privacy issues and gender verification together and implement our community feature into as many games as possible
